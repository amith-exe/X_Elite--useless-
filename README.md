Project Description

Stealth Messenger is our totally useless project‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre in the military, work in defense, or just enjoy hiding cat memes in images without anyone knowing.
It allows you to hide encrypted messages inside images using advanced bit manipulation, making them invisible to prying eyes. Only our software can decrypt them, ensuring maximum secrecy.

The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)

Ever had a life-or-death military secret‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt want to use WhatsApp because Mark Zuckerberg might be watching?
Or maybe you wanted to send your crush a love letter disguised as a JPEG of your lunch?
Yeah, we ‚Äúsolved‚Äù that problem.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We change the bits of your image so stealthily that even your GPU won‚Äôt notice.
